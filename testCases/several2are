============================
This test case is supposed to test some(x) --> are(x).

This test case used the follwing input:
Several great tenors are British.
---------------------------------------
There are great tenors who are British.

The LHS has the following parsing:
(exists x, (and (and (and (and (_several x) (_great x)) (_tenor x)) True) (_british x)))

The RHS has the following parsing:
(exists x z2, (and (and (and (and (_great z2) (_tenor z2)) (_british z2)) True) (x = z2)))

The parsings look fine.
